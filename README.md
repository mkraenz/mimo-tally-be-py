## Deployment

Deployed to Google Cloud Run using Terraform. See `infra/` dir.

Theres still old boilerplate in Deployment docs: [deployment.md](./deployment.md). I still have to read through it to decide what to delete exactly, particularly wrt to all the GitHub Actions things.

### Some env vars

The input variables, with their default values (some auto generated) are:

- `project_name`: (default: `"FastAPI Project"`) The name of the project, shown to API users (in .env).
- `stack_name`: (default: `"fastapi-project"`) The name of the stack used for Docker Compose labels and project name (no spaces, no periods) (in .env).
- `sentry_dsn`: (default: "") The DSN for Sentry, if you are using it, you can set it later in .env.
